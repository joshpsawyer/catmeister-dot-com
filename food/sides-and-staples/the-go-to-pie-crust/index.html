    <h1>The Go To Pie Crust</h1>
    
    <p>This is basically the same as the Sally's Baking Addiction Pie Crust<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> but it's
vegan so it's kind of a pain in the ass to manipulate. Earth balance makes it easier,
but the flavor is less buttery than if you use something like Country Crock Plant Butter.
I wouldn't bother with a higher end vegan butter like Miyoko's because it kind of
gets lost. Save that for slopping on bread, you slob.</p>
<p>Given in weight because you <em>really should be weighing your recipes</em>.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<p><li>
315g  all purpose flour
</li></p>
<p><li>
1 tsp  Diamond kosher salt
</li></p>
<p><li>
6T  (85g) Country Crock Plant Butter Sticks (the smaller you cut it up the faster you can incorporate it)
</li></p>
<p><li>
230g  Crisco Vegetable Shortening (DO NOT portion this ahead of time - put it directly into the flour in step 2)
</li></p>
<p><li>
1/2 cup  ice cold water
</li></p>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<p><li>
Whisk your flour and your salt together in a bowl.
</li></p>
<p><li>
Weigh directly into the flour the butter and the vegetable shortening. They're both greasy and soft and sticky and you'll lose a portion to your scoops / spoons / measuring tools, so if you put it directly into the flour you get it all in there... and you have less greasy dishes to clean.
</li></p>
<p><li>
Stir the bowl contents enough so that flour coats all the fat, then dump the bowl out onto a cleaning surface.
</li></p>
<p><li>
Using a fork or two forks or a bench knife or whatever you want, your fingers you mad lad, cut the butter / shortening combo into smaller pieces. You want something coarse and pebbly - some bigger chunks are okay.
</li></p>
<p><li>
Drizzle the water onto the dough and then stir until it clumps a bit and all the water is mixed in. There will be a lot of dry flour still - this is okay!
</li></p>
<p><li>
The odds are now against you. If you handle this too much with your hands, the heat will melt both the butter and shortening and turn you into a glistening mess. Using the bench knife and floured hands, you want to fold the dough onto itself. By folding, you're making layers of fat and flour that will result in a flaky pie crust. You can always add some more flour. Use the bench knife to scrape your surface to release stuck fat.
</li></p>
<p><li>
Once essentially all combined, some leftover chunks still okay, wrap it in plastic tightly and whack it into the freezer for a bit. The plant butters need the extra cold to really thicken up so you can roll this out easily.
