    <h1>How to Organize Your Godot Project Files</h1>
    
    <h2>Coming From Unity</h2>
<p>In Unity, I let the root project directory be a wild west of stuff because
importing things from the store, I could never be certain out files would be
structured. I adopted having one organized folder called <code>__Project</code> which I
kept <em>extremely</em> organized. All the art had a folder; prefabs had a folder;
ScriptableObjects had a folder; animation had a folder. It kind of worked, but
organizing by type meant also meant a lot of file juggling to make sure things
were in the right place... and it was an arbitrary rule I had copied from
somebody else's work.</p>
<h2>Two Root Folders</h2>
<p>In data analysis programming, I got into the habit of having a folder for raw
input data that I wouldn't touch, a folder for scripts to operate on the data,
and a folder for results. I've adopted a similar approach in Godot after
reviewing some articles on data organization. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>a root level folder called <code>assets</code> will contain the 'raw' data - that includes:
<ul>
<li>audio files, organized into an <code>audio</code> folder</li>
<li>aseprite files, organized into an <code>aseprite</code> folder</li>
<li>sprite files, organized into a <code>sprites</code> folder</li>
<li>music files, organized into a <code>music</code> folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>each asset <em>type</em> folder is then organized by scene ('prefab' if this were unity).</p>
<ul>
<li>a root level folder called <code>scenes</code> will contain the constructed data
<ul>
<li><em>every</em> scene gets its own subfolder in which it is saved.</li>
<li>the scripts for a scene live alongside the scene.</li>
<li>if the subnodes of a scene get complicated, they get their own folders too.</li>
<li>if the scenes have categories - characters, objects, etc. - they might get categorized by their type</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>theoretically</em>, if I was working with a team, then the people producing audio would only be concerned
with whats in the audio subfolder; similar to music, similar to aseprite. <em>inside</em> each type folder, the hierarchy of
the scenes folder is mirrored. if you've got a scene in <code>/scenes/characters/bob/</code> then all its assets will be organized by type
in their respective <code>/characters/bob/</code> folders.</p>
<p><strong>all files are named with snake case</strong>.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>I've got assets for a character named Squash. I've got some sound effects, some
running and walking and idling animations, and I'm making a scene for him. He'll be used
in a game consisting of one world scene. My project structure will look like:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">/assets/audio/character/squash/fart.wav
/assets/audio/character/squash/hello.wav
/assets/music/character/squash/squash_theme.wav
/assets/sprites/character/squash/squash_walk.png
/assets/sprites/character/squash/squash_run.png
/assets/sprites/character/squash/squash_idle.png
/assets/aseprite/character/squash/squash.aseprite
/scenes/character/squash/squash.tscn
/scenes/character/squash/squash.gd</code></pre>
<p>it's maybe redundant to have the sprites and the aseprite files in there - there are aseprite importers
that you can use to set up the animations from the raw aseprite data like <a href="https://github.com/nklbdev/godot-4-importality">importality</a>.</p>
<h2>WARNING WARNING</h2>
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> move files around outside of Godot! It WILL BREAK STUFF.</p>
