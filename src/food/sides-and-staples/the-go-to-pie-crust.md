This is basically the same as the Sally's Baking Addiction Pie Crust[^1] but it's
vegan so it's kind of a pain in the ass to manipulate. Earth balance makes it easier,
but the flavor is less buttery than if you use something like Country Crock Plant Butter.
I wouldn't bother with a higher end vegan butter like Miyoko's because it kind of
gets lost. Save that for slopping on bread, you slob.

Given in weight because you _really should be weighing your recipes_.
