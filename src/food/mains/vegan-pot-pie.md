There wass already a pretty good vegan pot pie recipe[^1], but I modified the
recipe to suit my tastes. Typically, this means upping the salt / seasonings and
cooking things longer / more intensely to get more flavor out of ingredients.

I also changed the pie crust in this one to [the go to pie crust](/food/sides-and-staples/the-go-to-pie-crust) and sandwichd herbs in it
and brushed it with egg and topped with flaky salt. So if you use the egg wash, it's not vegan.
