**CATMEISTER** is:

- a place for written tutorials & techniques because I cannot retain
    knowledge from a video for the life of me and occasionally I take very long
    breaks from doing stuff and forget how to do everything
- some experiments and ascii art
- copyright &copy; 2024

this site uses `Fixedsys` for headers and a stack of `Courier`, `Courier Prime`, `Courier New` or another `sans-serif` font for body text.
